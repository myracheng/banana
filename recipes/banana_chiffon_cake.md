# Banana Chiffon Cake
My first time making a chiffon cake! Crumb was a bit uneven but it was very yummy. Tasted like banana bread but more refined and lighter.

## info  
* Didn't use any weights. It's the wild wild west out here

## ingredients
* 2 cups flour
* 1 1/4 cup granulated sugar
* 1 tbsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp table salt
* 1/2 cup vegetable oil
* 5 egg yolks
* 1/2 cup cold water
* 1 cup very ripe mashed banana (approx. 2 bananas)
* 8 egg whites
* tiny splash of lemon juice

## steps  
1. Preheat oven to 325F.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt until well combined. Make a well in the center. Add oil, unbeaten yolks, water, and mashed bananas. Beat until smooth, about 2 minutes.
3. In a separate bowl, beat together the egg whites and lemon juice on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, about 4 min. Be sure itâ€™s at stiff peaks, not soft peaks.
4. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold together the banana mixture into the egg white mixture. Carefully fold repeatedly until batter is incorporated, but do not over-handle the batter.
5. Pour batter into an *ungreased* tube pan with removable center/bottom. Bake 60 minutes or just until toothpick inserted in center comes out almost clean (a few small tender crumbs attached is perfect.)
6. Invert the pan over a plate; keep pan inverted until cake is completely cool. Once cooled, use a very thin knife and run it carefully around all edges of the cake to loosen cake. Turn upside down onto a plate, and carefully remove the bottom/center of pan from the cake.

## notes  
* Be careful with the removable bottom of a pan -- mine was leaky and a lot of the batter spilled out.
