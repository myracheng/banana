# Flour Bakery's Banana Bread

## info  
* light, fluffy banana bread
* optional step: roast bananas in the oven to soften them

## ingredients
* 210 g (1 2/3 cups) flour
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* 200 g (1 cup) sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 100 g (1/2 cup) oil
* 340 g (3.5) very ripe bananas, mashed
* 2 tbsp Chobani yogurt
* sugar and/or extra bananas for sprinkling on top

## steps  
1. Preheat oven to 325F. Line 9x13 pan with parchment paper.
2. Beat together the sugar and eggs on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Switch to low speed and slowly drizzle in the oil, taking your time. Add the bananas and yogurt, and continue to mix on low speed just until combined.
3. Dump the dry ingredients on top and mix them so that they are interspersed. Then mix all of the batter.
4.  Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan(s).
5.  Cover the top with sugar for a crunchy crust and decorate with banana slices.
6.  Bake for 40 min - 1 hour. The loaves should be golden brown on top and the cake will spring back when you press it. Let cool in the pan on a wire rack for 30 minutes, remove from the pan and let cool completely on paper towels.
